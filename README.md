### Hi, My name is Venkatanarayanan ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Analyst with specific interest in Data Visualisation. My Data Analysis journey started roughly three years back and since then I have created numerous visualisations using R and other tools. I have created these visuals not just for me but also for others as a part of my freelance work. I have thoroughly enjoyed this journey and I am always looking to learn more. I am available to consult for Data Analytics / Data Visualisation
